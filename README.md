# Portfolio

Here I have compiled code from some of my projects. I'll have the code sorted in project folders and there I'll add a README for further documentation on each project.

Brief introduction:

- Automated Testing & DI is a learning project, where I'm demonstrating the use of:
  - Dependency Injection using Zenject
  - Automated Testing using Unity Test Runner
  - Reactive Extensions using UniRX

- Little Miss Magic demonstrates some of the code I created during my time at Roseine. Be sure to take a look at README to get started on what is going on in there.

- Third Person RPG is an older project where I tried different kind of approaches building features and architecture.
