This is a project from 2018 which I spent quite a bit of time on. This is the project I really started trying my wings with programming and project architecture. I included the project to showcase a bit of variety and progress I have made as a programmer.

What I think I did right:

- I think creating a ScriptableObject to hold all the Player design data was a nifty way to have a lot of variables stored in once place. It would have a risk of conflicts if Designer tried to tweak values when the Programmer is changing the PlayerProfile script.

What I think could be done better:

- I have mixed feelings about the architecture I used on PlayerController. I think creating strict capsulations of features helped getting focused bodies of code but my execution felt akward. I'm 100% positive that I would never include multiple features in a single script if I was working with other programmers.
